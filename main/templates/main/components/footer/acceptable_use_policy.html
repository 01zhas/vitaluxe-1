        <h1>Interactive services</h1>

        <p>We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site.</p>

        <p>
            Where we provide any interactive service, we will provide 
            clear information to you about the kind of service offered, 
            if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used.
        </p>


        <blockquote>
            We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users 
            (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they 
            use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide 
            in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant 
            service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. 
            However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate 
            any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly 
            exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use 
            of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content 
            standards, whether the service is moderated or not. 
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is 
            subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. 
            We advise parents who permit their children to use an 
            interactive service that it is important that they communicate 
            with their children about their safety online, 
            as moderation is not fool proof. Minors who are using any 
            interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. 
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Where we do moderate an interactive service, 
            we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, 
            should a concern or difficulty arise.
        </p>
